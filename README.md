# sark-douls
An esoteric programming "language" made by two idiots at one in the morning. 

The language is based on a pointer moving along a list of characters, and then picking one to insert into a string.

There are only six commands in Sark Douls;

str     |   	Move the pointer to the right

dex	    |    Move the pointer to the left

praise  |  	Add pointed character to the string

PRAISE  |  	Add pointed character to the string uppercased

light   |  	Show the string

die     |    Empty the string and set pointer to 0

Hopefully it works.
