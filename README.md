# sark-douls
An esoteric programming "language" made by two idiots at one in the morning. 

The language is based on a pointer moving along a list of characters, and then picking one to insert into a string.

There are only six commands in Sark Douls;

str        	Move the pointer to the right\n
dex	        Move the pointer to the left\n
praise    	Add pointed character to the string\n
PRAISE    	Add pointed character to the string uppercased\n
light     	Show the string\n
die         Empty the string and set pointer to 0\n

Hopefully it works.
